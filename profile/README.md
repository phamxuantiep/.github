**tiep** is an bargain platform for community which help consumers save a few bucks or discount percent when purchasing on large market like Amazon, Ebay, Coles, Aldi and more.

Mainly market serve at Australia and New Zealand.

Put the consumers first. Sweat the little details. Hunt for good DEALS.

Despite my current position, I’m always curious about new challenges through collaborations and freelance opportunities. Reach out at tiep@tiep.au
